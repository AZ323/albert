<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language. In this case, United States English. Search engines, browsers, and screen readers use this information to deliver content specific to user needs.-->

<head>
<!--The <head> element contains additional information for search engines and browsers.--> 
<!--The <title> tag controls the name on the browser tab and the next line of code adds a favicon image.-->

<!--Glitch a .jpg image by editing the source code. Open the digital image file using “text/edit” on Macs (located in Launchpad/other), "Notepad" on Windows, or "text" on Chromebooks (located in App launcher). Make a test glitch: scroll down to the middle of the document. Copy, cut, move, and paste 10-20 lines of code. Hit save. Then open the original image to see what has changed. Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg." If an image is larger than 1200px in width, you will want to resize it speed up load time. Crop image height to ensure desired fit.--> 

<!--The "hero-image" properties are controlled on the style.css document. We know this because the <div> calls the class="hero-image".

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> I can start by saying that im Ukrainian, a big and little brother, and someone who loves to play sports. Im from a town called Kennett Square, it's a very nice and diverse town with lots of random things to do and see. Oddly enough it is called the "mushroom capital of the world" and there are mushroom-themed events throughout the year. Some include the "Mushroom Festival" and the New Year's Eve "Mushroom Drop". When I was younger, I found the easiest way to connect with my family was to play video games with them for hours on end, with some of my favorites being Mortal Kombat and Wii Sports Resort. This fondness for games sparked an interest in coding for me when I was younger and it led me to take an AP Computer Science class. It also highlighted my passion for building computers, as I've custom-made the one im typing on and several others.  </p>

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Dear Data: Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>Code is in every aspect of our lives, it can be massively impactful like increasing transportation and business affairs, or it can be in smaller things like social media and Alexa. Either way, code is used every day and without it, our societies would fundamentally change as a whole. The dear data visualization activity put into perspective the amount of time I was truly spending on social media. It was surprising because day to day you don't notice how much time is taken up by unimportant phone usage. The activity did make me consciously decide to use my phone less for the following week, and a noticeable difference in the time I have left in a day is quite surprising. The one thing that surprised me about the data was the ratio of picking up my phone and going into an app compared to how much time I truly spent in the app. While TikTok was the leading app in hours, it was the least first picked after first opening up my phone, while Snapchat was the most by a landslide, beating other apps by three or even four times.        </p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>Learning in a classroom with just paper and pen for me and many of my peers was a challenging, strenuous, and time-wasting practice that has, thankfully, completely gone out of fashion in college. Code and digital technology change everything we know about how we learn and do tasks and improve it exponentially. From the simple things of not having to use different writing utensils and extra pages to the complexity of being able to manipulate PDFs in meticulous ways, it isn't surprising that in all my lectures everyone has a computer or tablet on their desks. By learning more about how we can use code and technology in classrooms we will be able to move past our outdated teaching and learning styles and improve our society as a whole.  </p>
